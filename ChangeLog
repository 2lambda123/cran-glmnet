	* glmnet.Rd (lambda.min) : changed value to 0.01 if nobs<nvars
	  (lambda) added warnings to avoid single value
	  (lambda.min): renamed it lamda.min.ratio
	* glmnet (lambda.min) : changed	value to 0.01 if nobs<nvars
	    (HessianExact) : changed the sense (it was wrong)
	   (lambda.min): renamed it lamda.min.ratio # this allows it to be called lambda.min in a call though
	* predict.cv.glmnet (new function) : makes predictions directly from the saved glmnet object on the cv object
	* coef.cv.glmnet (new function) : as above
	* predict.cv.glmnet.Rd : help functions for the above
	* cv.glmnet : insert drop(y) to avoid 1 column matrices
	    now include a glmnet.fit object for later predictions
	* nonzeroCoef : added a special case for a single variable in x; it was dying on this
	* deviance.glmnet : included
	* deviance.glmnet.Rd : included
